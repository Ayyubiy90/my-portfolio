# Backend Directory Notice

This backend directory is currently not in use as the functionality has been migrated to serverless functions on Vercel. 

The existing code and structure may be retained for potential future use, depending on the project's requirements. 

If additional server-side logic or features are needed in the future, this backend can be revisited and integrated as necessary.

For now, please refer to the serverless functions located in the `api` folder for any backend-related functionality.

Thank you!
